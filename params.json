Once connected to the address:\r\n\r\n1. If connected with a **mobile phone** with accelerators enabled, it will start move as you move your phone.\r\n2. If connected with a **computer**, you will have a control panel where you can command your robot or see sensor readers\r\n\r\n![Robot](https://raw.github.com/nicolagreco/Node-BERRY-Accelerator/master/machine.gif)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How to install\r\n\r\nInstall nodejs on the machine (you can also test it on the simulator - you still need node-js)\r\n\r\n    wget http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.11/node-v0.8.11.tar.gz\r\n    tar -zxf node-v0.8.11.tar.gz\r\n    cd node-v0.8.11\r\n    ./configure\r\n    make\r\n    sudo make install\r\n\r\nYou may also want to install `npm`. In case you have problems installing node, run `make test`.\r\n\r\nOnce installed, set up BERRY's environment:\r\n\r\n    npm install .\r\n\r\nAnd now you are ready to execute it:\r\n\r\n  node server.js IPADDRESS PORT\r\n  // in case you want to connect locally 127.0.0.1 55443\r\n\r\nYou can access it through localhost, or from multiple devices through the computer address where hosted.\r\n\r\n## Technologies used\r\n\r\n- node-js 0.8\r\n- socket-io\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\n\r\n![Robot](http://twitpic.com/proxy/web24/img/718513045-566498e2149c4050b45ce8c123b85c79.50f706c0-scaled.png)\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\nNicola Greco - everyone is welcome to join.\r\n","name":"Node-berry-accelerator","note":"Don't delete this file!
